## Sleep-Tracking MERN-Stack Project

### What are Artifacts and What do they Represent?
<p>One of the requirements of the Computer Science Capstone course was publishing at least one with a maximum of three artifacts. Artifacts are meant to represent my personal growth in Southern New Hampshire University’s Computer Science program. With each artifact, I was to demonstrate enhancements in <strong>Software Design and Engineering</strong>, <strong>Algorithms and Data Structures</strong>, and <strong>Databases</strong>. Below you can find the artifact and corresponding enhancements.</p>

### What is the Artifact?
The sleep-tracking application development began in May of 2021 and was completed in late June 2021 (21EW5) for Southern New Hampshire University’s **Computer Science Capstone (CS-499-T5475)**. The artifact presented in my ePortfolio is a sleep-tracking SPA (single-page application) that was developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). The sleep-tracking application can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) usernames, sleep goals, and sleep journals. Additional features include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request methods to open-source APIs (application programming interface) such as NASA’s [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) that returns an astronomy-related image with a description each day. I also included a dream word interpreter that displays the user’s journal entry, allows them to input a word into the search bar, and the DataMuse API call returns adjectives relating to the user-selected word to assist in the interpretation of the user’s dream journal entry. Sleep metrics are also displayed to the user via a line chart that extracts the duration of the user's sleep journal into the line chart's dataset.

### Justification
I determined that the artifacts within my sleep-tracking application would be an advantageous addition to my ePortfolio since the development of a MERN-stack application demonstrates comprehension of software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. This comprehension stems from the ability to develop and integrate front and back-end architecture to meet the required functionality of the application and user’s needs. 

### Reflection
<p>The process of enhancing the MERN stack template began with planning the functionality and complexity of my application. I wanted to alter and expand upon the exercise-tracking application template by incorporating functionality such as API calls and additional database schemas. Also, providing the user with a sleep-metrics line chart will allow them to track their sleep duration from their sleep journal entries.</p>
<p>One challenge that I faced while developing my project was integrating API request and response data into React components and states, especially for the HTTP request methods that required user parameters. Concepts such as string interpolation with template literals as the user’s parameters alleviated this hurdle and allowed me to integrate URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) component encoding for increased security.</p>
<p>Since this sleep-tracking application was my first project using the MERN stack, professor-provided feedback was essential in the creation and revisions of my project. The feedback given from each milestone provided me with suggestions to improve my final project and the narrative that would encompass the overall aim of the project and ePortfolio. With each milestone covering software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases, I would integrate the feedback into both my narratives and project revisions.</p>
